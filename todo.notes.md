## Compound Posts

Perhaps split up different types of markdown posts rather than trying to go through so much trouble to get the examples to map correctly...

Could create a special type of file (`file.compound.md`) that takes like an introduction and then just an array of posts in its frontmatter. This would allow you to compose a bunch of 'mini-posts' with their own examples into a larger post. Almost like a modular post type thing.
