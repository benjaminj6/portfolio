# Writing Guidelines

_These are generic guidelines‚Äîthey do not need to be followed strictly! They're here to help me remember a few things and maintain a consistent voice in my writing._

## General

- When using uncommon abbreviations or initials, write it out the first time and put the abbreviation in parentheses. After that, use it freely. (This doesn't apply to common abbreviations like HTML, CSS, JS, etc).
- Don't overuse **bold** and _italic_ within sentances! This makes them lose their meaning.

## Preferred spellings & grammar

- Use **front-end** instead _frontend_ or _front end_.
- Use **back-end** instead of _backend_ or _back end_.
- Use **oxford commas** at the end of lists. Sorry not sorry ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

## Code samples

- Use a `.` at the beginning of CSS classes in inline code (i.e. "we'll add `.expanded` to the `did`")
- Prefer plain JavaScript over TypeScript for examples if possible.
