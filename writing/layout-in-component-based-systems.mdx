## Thesis

_A component should handle the whitespace surrounding its children, NOT the whitespace surrounding itself_.

---

Let's dive into this a little more.

In some ways this is a rather bold statementâ€”you mean my component shouldn't _ever_ have its own padding or margin?

To be honest I haven't seen this approach that often in all my years of building websites. CSS usually gets thrown together a little haphazardly, padding and margin get thrown wherever they get the job done.

Additionally, we have also been taught to use as few HTML tags as possible, letting CSS do the heavy lifting. Or at least I was taught this. You write the minimum necessary HTML, and _only then_ you add CSS without creating more `div`s. Last thing we want is "divitis" (TODO: link).

This approach might work if you have an entire page in a single HTML file, but it doesn't quite translate to apps and design systems where _components_ are our primary building blocks.

I think we've let the fear of divitis cloud our thinking a bit. Semantic HTML is still important, but if adding a `div` lets us split our style rules more logically it could be worth it. Like everything in software, it's all about tradeoffs.

## How keeping surrounding whitespace simplifies layout

- a component should be a self-contained unit of composition
- a component should be droppable anywhere in the app without side-effects
- we want to reduce to the cognitive load of using a component's API.
  - Surrounding whitespace _increases_ this because you have to think about both the component's inherent whitespace _and_ the container's layout whitespace.
  - Keeping a component free of surrounding whitespace lets us split apart the layout concerns we have to keep in our head. We can think of a component as concerned with the whitespace of its children at all times if we keep it free of its own surrounding whitespace.
