Scaling CSS can be notoriously tricky. Contrary to jabs and ribs about it being "just center this `div` vertically" or "move the button `2px` to the left", CSS is an _essential_ part of the front-end web stack.

Given the importance of CSS, I've found myself thinking about its role in scalable apps and maintainable codebased—in some ways getting CSS "right" is just as important as your HTML and JS. Even in a world dominated by JS frameworks. 

A solid CSS approach can mean the difference between an "append-only stylesheet" and code that's scalable, flexible, and (dare-I-say) enjoyable to work with.

_CSS being difficult is one of the reasons that frameworks like [Bootstrap](TODO:), [Material-UI](TODO:), and [Tailwind CSS](TODO:) are so popular. They make a difficult problem seem_

In modern web applications, I've myself working increasingly with the _component_ as the unit of composition rather than _pages_. By this I mean that we split our CSS by components (single CSS file per component rather than one per page). We look at pages as collections of 
self-contained components. We handle state and data-fetching and user interactions at the component level rather than at a larger page level.

However, even though we've _started_ thinking in components, I'd argue that some of our approaches to CSS still draw from a page-based model.

Especially margin and padding.

On most of the apps I've worked on, the instinct seems to be to shove margin and padding wherever they "get the job done". We learned that less DOM elements is better, that "divitis is bad", and that "HTML comes first, CSS follows" (or at least I originally did). As a result we start with a minimal set of HTML and shove CSS wherever we can to get an appropriate representation of the UI. We pass CSS classes into our components so that we can go even further—overriding our own styles to make small adjustments like padding and margin.

_None of these things are inherently "wrong". But they do introduce trade-offs and we should be wary of taking them as gospel truth.

</Callout>

In the apps I've built, I've found it helpful to revisit some of these principles. I've started to look at CSS as a first-class citizen in my apps—it's not always HTML-first, CSS-next. `div`s aren't inherently evil. Lately, I've been following this aphorism when I'm approaching a complex CSS layout:

> A component should not "own" its own surrounding whitespace, but it can own the whitsepace surrounding its direct children.

This allows us to split out our CSS whitespace rules as a specific concern a component can have. Once we've established that whitespace is different (and follows different rules) than styles like borders, colors, and fonts, we can now dive into _which_ components the whitespace concern belongs to.

This doesn't forbid components from owning _any_ whitespace—otherwise we wouldn't be able to put spacing in our apps! Instead, it's focused only on the _whitespace surrounding the component_.

For instance, if we have a `Button` component with a surrounding margin:

```
TODO: example
```

If we 
<!--

<!-- ## Thesis

_A component should handle the whitespace surrounding its children, NOT the whitespace surrounding itself_.

Let's dive into this a little more.

In some ways this is a rather bold statement—you mean my component shouldn't _ever_ have its own padding or margin?

To be honest I haven't seen this approach that often in all my years of building websites. CSS usually gets thrown together a little haphazardly, padding and margin get thrown wherever they get the job done.

Additionally, we have also been taught to use as few HTML tags as possible, letting CSS do the heavy lifting. Or at least I was taught this. You write the minimum necessary HTML, and _only then_ you add CSS without creating more `div`s. Last thing we want is "divitis" (TODO: link).

This approach might work if you have an entire page in a single HTML file, but it doesn't quite translate to apps and design systems where _components_ are our primary building blocks.

I think we've let the fear of divitis cloud our thinking a bit. Semantic HTML is still important, but if adding a `div` lets us split our style rules more logically it could be worth it. Like everything in software, it's all about tradeoffs.

## How keeping surrounding whitespace simplifies layout

- a component should be a self-contained unit of composition
- a component should be droppable anywhere in the app without side-effects
- we want to reduce to the cognitive load of using a component's API.
  - Surrounding whitespace _increases_ this because you have to think about both the component's inherent whitespace _and_ the container's layout whitespace.
  - Keeping a component free of surrounding whitespace lets us split apart the layout concerns we have to keep in our head. We can think of a component as concerned with the whitespace of its children at all times if we keep it free of its own surrounding whitespace. -->
