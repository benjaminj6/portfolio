## What even is a service worker?

It was much more difficult than to find a _definition_ for a service worker. There's ton's of tutorials and articles on _how_ to set up a service worker and what they're used for, but at the most fundamental level we want to know _what_ a service worker is.

However, I was able to find a few articles that gave some comprehensive definitions for service workers and how they work (pun intended) under the hood, notably this article from [Chrome developer resources](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers/)

> "A service worker is a script that your browser runs in the background, separate from a web page, opening the door to features that don't need a web page or user interaction"

Similar to _web workers_, a service worker runs _off the main thread_ of the JavaScript runtime. Since it's not on the main thread, the service worker doesn't have any access to the DOM or any JavaScript running on the main threadâ€”it's only way to communicate with the main thread is via the `postMessage` API
