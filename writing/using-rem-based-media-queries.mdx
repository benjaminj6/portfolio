To do a `rem`-based media query, you can use `rem` as the width in your CSS:

```css
@media screen and (min-width: 48rem) {
  /*  Styles for tablets and above */
}
```

One key benefit of using `rem` units for media queries is _accessibility_.

I often bump my font size up larger than the default. While I can see fine without it I find the larger font sizes relaxing on my eyes.

This allows you to scale your layout with the font-sizing preferences. So if you're on a tablet screen (~768px) but the user has a 150% font size, they would see the _mobile_ layout. This mobile layout is more helpful if your font is taking up a significant portion of your tablet-sized screen width.

Lastly, a couple caveats to this approach. First, if you're actually changing the `font-size` on the `html` element, this might not be for you. Second, `rem`-based media queries can take a while to get used to. You'll have to do some math if you need to figure out standard screen sizes (for example, `768 / 16` results in `48rem`).

That said, I think the benefits (accessibility) outweigh the cost of unfamiliarity. And I've rarely (never?) had to actually change the `font-size` on `html`!
