Essentially, don't hold back on creating things & learning for fear of creating something bad. It's much better to make a lot of anything than to make 0 bad things.

This doesn't mean you throw quality out the window, rather you recognize that you will not be perfect the first, second, or even hundredth time you do something. Rather than shooting for perfection _every single time_, shoot for the best possible at this point in time, and then continue creating & refining.
