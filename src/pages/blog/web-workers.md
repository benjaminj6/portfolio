Little blurb at the beginning to show as a preview and introduce the post and cool stuff like that. Make sure that it's always over 140 characters or else.

## What Is A Web Worker?

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.

## Why Should I Care About Web Workers?

Say that before we go into depth over web workers it's worth talking a bit about why they matter, why you would want to use one.

```javascript
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  console.log(i)
}
```

## The Worker Environment

Give some notes about the worker environment...basically that we don't have access to the normal JavaScript globals/the `window` object
