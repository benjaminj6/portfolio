I've been fortunate to instruct & work with many people that are just learning to code through the very same bootcamp I attended about a year and a half ago ([Thinkful](https://www.thinkful.com/) &mdash; yes this is a shameless plug ðŸ˜œ). It's awesome &mdash; I get to give back & invest in others' careers, while also getting to  work on my public speaking. Most recently I've been doing a series of workshops on using Chrome Devtools, where I teach some common parts of Chrome DevTools that many front-end developers are using daily.

I didn't learn how to use Chrome DevTools until I got on my first gig. I knew how to do the basics &mdash; preview CSS changes, change HTML, basically a bit of the stuff inside the `Elements` tab. 

I've also heard similar stories from some of my colleagues at my current job &mdash; debugging & developer tools aren't usually learned until _after_ people get out on their first gig.

My most recent workshop focused on the Chrome DevTools "Network" tab: how to analyze your load time & other "productivity hacks" I've picked up. One of the key "tricks" that I shared was the motivation for writing this article.

## The Problem: Log, Log, Everywhere

One of the earlier lessons in the process of learning web development is learning about fetching data via AJAX. Most apps that goes beyond triviality or need to respond to data dynamically are gonna fetch some JSON from an API, and then operate on that JSON.

Many times, I would find myself doing something like this in my source code so that I could preview the JSON response.

```javascript
fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts')
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(json => {
    console.log(json) // to see what the response was
    // code operate on the JSON goes here
  })
```

To preview my JSON, I'd either scatter `console.log` all over my codebase and dig through browser console to find my JSON, or I'd go copy-paste the endpoint into Postman or a `cURL` request. All of these work, but **what if there was a faster way to debug JSON responses in the browser?**

## Chrome DevTools To the Rescue!

Thanks to Chrome DevTools, we can preview our JSON _without touching our source code_ (a.k.a. higher productivity & a smaller chance that you accidentally forget to delete a `console.log`).

### 1. Open the Network Tab

I'm gonna be demonstrating all of this on one of my own apps, called [Horizon](https://benjaminj6.github.io/horizon). It's essentially a sunset tracker, pulling data from https://sunrise-sunset.org/. You're welcome to follow along or use any app of your choice, provided it sends JSON over the internet.

First, since we're gonna be debugging via the Network Tab, we'll want to open that up. Once you've got it open, you'll see something like this.

![network tab open](https://res.cloudinary.com/da2iq7dge/image/upload/v1517120282/network_tab_open_xwckl5.png)

Great! Now we're all set to start our debugging.

### 2. Filter by `XHR`

While my sample app may not have a ton of requests, many apps can contain 100+ requests on initial page load, making it a little more difficult to find the specific AJAX request we're looking for.

Fortunately, Chrome DevTools lets us filter by response type. You'll see all of the options available to you near the top bar. Select **`XHR`** (this stands for **X**ml**H**ttp**R**equest), which contains all JSON data pulled into the app via `fetch` (or `$.ajax`, `axios`, or whatever way you're using to grab your data).

With the response filtered, your Network Tab should look like this:

![network tab filtered](https://res.cloudinary.com/da2iq7dge/image/upload/v1517120282/devtools_filter_xhr_bfh1x5.png)

That's really slick! Now we only have to parse through a few requests to find what we're looking for.

### 3. Inspect & Preview...Voila!

Find the request that you're interested in. Click on the request and you should see a menu like this pop up.

![network request inspect](https://res.cloudinary.com/da2iq7dge/image/upload/v1517120283/devtools_view_request_rvmirk.png)

The final step is for us to select that `Preview` tab. Once selected, you should see something like this.

![preview pane with json](https://res.cloudinary.com/da2iq7dge/image/upload/v1517120282/devtools_preview_json_re3xgb.png)

There's our JSON! We've successfully found it _without touching our source code_. This means we can use this method of debugging _anywhere we can use Chrome DevTools_ &mdash; including debugging sites in production with minified JavaScript.

## Conclusion

If you're a seasoned pro & read all the way to the end, you might be thinking, "I've known this for years". However, when I first discovered this method of debugging network requests, I felt like I had just been given superpowers. A well-placed `console.log` can be an extremely effective tool, but scattering it all over source code felt much like the whole "Maslow's Hammer" dilemma:
