My wife is from Las Vegas. At New Years Eve this year, Las Vegas swarmed with over 300,000 guest. Some of those guests lefts a lot richer than when they arrived, no doubt having won a sheer stroke of luck (or maybe skill, they claim). Others, not so much.

Learning new technologies can sometimes feel akin to gambling &mdash; especially if you value your time. You can sink hours of personal time into learning some new framework, language, or programming paradigm only to watch it fall into obscurity 3 months later. On the flipside, there's tremendous gains to be won if you choose correctly and become an early adopter of "the next big thing".

2017 was a big year for me &mdash; at the beginning of the year I was just starting to dive into React & the modern JavaScript ecosystem. Up until then, I'd mostly been working with more legacy codebases & jQuery as the frontend library of choice. And now, less than 1 year later, I've been working as a professional React developer for roughly 6 months at a top-notch [startup](https://www.autogravity.com) based in Irvine.

Throughout the last year I took some gambles on technologies worth learning &mdash; I won a few, and had quite a few that didn't pay off as well as I'd hoped.

Anyways, here's some things I'm placing bets on & watching/diving into in 2018.

1. **React**<br />
  This is a safe bet. But it's also hard to ignore that React is currently the 200-ton juggernaut in the front-end space, and it doesn't look like anything is going to usurp its position soon. I'm using React every day at work, and it's not too much extra effort to stay up to date on modern component architectures, API changes, best practices, etc. happening in the React space.
1. **WebAssembly**<br />
  In mid-November of 2017 [Mozilla announced](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/11/13/webassembly-in-browsers/) that support for WebAssembly ships by default in all major modern browsers (sorry, IE11 users, but you're not a major browser anymore). With growing support of this new web standard I think we will start to see new paradigms and use cases pop up as many traditionally server-side & embedded systems programming languages become available on the web.
1. **Web Components & Custom Elements**<br />
  Web Components/Custom Elements allow for a ton of awesome things in front-end development. An obvious plus from using them is simple framework-agnostic sharing of styles & UI components. This means that developers using these components (whether it's you using your own, open source users, or other developers within your organization) don't have to bother about which framework/library/rendering engine you used to write components, they can simply use them the same way they use a `<button>` or a `input` tag. Furthermore, it will be interesting to see what front-end architectures arise as companies use custom elements more and more &mdash; some people are already advocating for a "[microservices for the front-end](https://micro-frontends.org/)" approach towards building UIs.
1. **CSS Variables**<br />
  CSS Custom Properties (CSS Variables) are currently supported in the four major modern browsers. They essentially allow you to store values in a variable that is evaluated by the CSS parser at runtime. This is far more flexible & leads to more interesting usages than preprocessor variables that get evaluated in a compile step. I think that much like we saw **tons** of best practices & tutorials emerging for CSS Grid in the latter half of 2017, we're gonna see tons of developers discovering & sharing best practices around CSS Custom properties in 2018.
1. **GraphQL**<br />
  GraphQL got reeeallly big in 2017. Right now, the list of companies using this technology is a who's who of the tech scene: Facebook, GitHub, Pinterest, Intuit, etc. Basically, GraphQL operates as a "query language for you API", allowing the consumer of the API to recieve only the data they've explicitly requested. However, I'm seeing a trend of beginning to use GraphQL for querying things other than API endpints &mdash; [Gatsby's](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/) currently using it to query all data & generate static sites, and I recently saw [another project](https://dev-blog.apollodata.com/the-future-of-state-management-dd410864cae2) working to use GraphQL as a frontend state management tool.

Let's set one thing straight here, though. **It's 100% possible that I'm incorrect about any of these predictions.** After all, choosing technologies is gambling, and when you gamble sometimes you lose. However, these are all technologies that I've seen gaining traction in 2017 and I think they all show promise. It's also important to remember that this list isn't inclusive of _every thing that's interesting_ to me, but rather kinda a "top picks" specifically for the front-end web development space. If we were to throw back-end development or mobile or anything else into the mix, I'm sure there would be other things that are intriguing and exciting.
