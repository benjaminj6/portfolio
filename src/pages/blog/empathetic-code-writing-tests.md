> Essentially this value of empathy among software developers is extremely underrated, especially when it comes to code we write: we tend to think only in the short term and not about the long-term effects of our actions on a codebase

> For example, technology decisions. Just because some language is cool or you really like it doesn't mean it's the best decision for a codebase. Keeping things as simple as possible is usually the best bet for the long-term, since it allows you to adapt your codebase much more easily when new business requirements show up.

> Another common example is when many business / developers decide that they "don't have time to write test automation". This is a huge mistake and tends to destroy team morale, developer productivity, and code cleanliness in the long run. It also has the side effect of discouraging refactoring since it's so difficult to verify a refactor didn't break stuff.

> Another big example can be when there is a bunch of tribal knowledge when it comes to a codebase. Need to know how to get it running? Ask so-and-so. Oh, you want to know what that module does? No one really knows, you'll just have to read the code. Have a junior developer coming on board? How long will it take them to learn the ins & outs of the codebase? Is it weeks or months?
