Intro: Talk about April Wensel & Compassionate Coding

Decisions made in codebases tend to have long-term effects. Sometimes it's a prototype (done over a week or two, hackathon-style) that turned into the production app. Other times developers cut corners to meet business targets, but they're never given the time to clean up the codebase. As a result, things continue to rot away and the code becomes more and more convoluted.

Such codebases can often be characterized by the difficulty it takes for a new developer to onboard. Any codebase of moderate to large size will take some time for a new team member to intake, but non-empathetic codebases can take _months_ for people to figure out how the thing actually works.

It doesn't have to be this way. What if a codebase was characterized by the amount that it _helped_ developers get up to speed rather than the hurdles that need to be overcome? What if codebases became a joy to work in rather than a burden?

Decisions in codebases have a tendency to stick around
- simple prototype turned into the real thing
- rushing to meet a business need shot codebase in the foot
- developers didn't see value in automatic testing and now the codebase is so big that manual testing can take days

These types of codebases tend to be characterized not by their empathy and approachability, but rather by feeling daunting. Such a codebase can often be characterized by how difficult it is to get running or the level of effort for a junior developer or new team member to make a change.

However, it doesn't have to be this way. What if codebases were inviting and welcoming rather than staring down a 100-foot monster?

This is where craftsmanship comes into play.

<!--
A codebase that has become stagnant and is rotting can really destroy developer productivity, increase bug counts, decrease motivation to maintain code

However, just introducing "good software practices" for the sake of having them doesn't help anyone with the _why_. And it's good to pitch these good software practices in terms of numbers (aka revenue) but we also have to remember that many of these software practices are a way of being empathetic to team members.

In this article we'll examine a few common software practices thru the lens of empathy and see how they can help us create codebase that are welcoming and inclusive rather than daunting and scary.

<!--
1. Writing tests is empathetic
2. Adding documentation & comments is empathetic
3. Automate repetitve tasks like linting and formatting to provide a more empathetic feedback loop.
