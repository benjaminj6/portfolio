  <p class="jsx-3386128420">
    Hi, I'm Ben. I'm a musician-turned-frontend-dev based out of the greater Los Angeles area. I sometimes make things with code (ok actually, I do that all the time). Working as a frontend dev means that I am constantly evaluating the latest and greatest trends in web development for their usability, scalability, &amp; ability to provide real-world solutions (as well as the number of emojis in their README ðŸ˜Ž).
  </p>
  <p class="jsx-3386128420">
    Currently I'm working at a

      fintech startup in Irvine
    </A>
     to make the car-buying/financing process as simple as it can be using the power of the mobile web.
  </p>
  <p class="jsx-3386128420">
    In addition to working as a frontend developer, I like to give back to my community. I occasionally do workshops for students learning to code, and try to write some articles here and there (in between everything else!).
